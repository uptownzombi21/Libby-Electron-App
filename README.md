# If you are looking for this, then you probably know what a "Libby" is (lol) and wat an "App" is


So...ummm... I built this app so that I can not only read books on my tablet, but also on my commputer. I think it will probably work well with the windows Kindle app since they are not directly related



Looking for a different version? You can actually compile it self XD, sorry i didnt compile it for your system (I dont have time because of school). DONT DOWNLOAD THE SOURCE CODE FROM THE RELEASE/CODE SECTION, i will provide it in the [compile.md](https://github.com/uptownzombi21/Libby-Electron-App/blob/main/compile.md)
